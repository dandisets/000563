description: "Some visual neurons have been shown to respond to white noise flicker
  visual stimuli with high temporal precision, particularly retinal ganglion cells
  and LGN relay cells. Responses to white noise stimulation are useful for a variety
  of analyses, including information theoretic measures and generative models of precise
  spike timing. However the literature was lacking data on responses to white noise
  in cortical visual areas, or in the visual stream flowing through the superior colliculus.\n
  \nThis experiment used the OpenScope Neuropixels passive viewing protocol, and displayed
  visual stimuli modulated in time by a short, repeated white noise sequence. The
  visual stimulus was either a spatially uniform field whose luminance was modulated
  in time (Full Field Flicker), or a standing sinusoidal grating whose contrast was
  modulated in time (Static Gratings). Perhaps surprisingly, most cortical visual
  neurons responded well to full-field flicker white noise.  To obtain large populations
  of neurons in subcortical areas, roughly half of the mice were recorded in a novel
  electrode configuration. \n\nWhen white noise visual stimuli are presented repeatedly
  and the neural responses displayed as spike rasters, the rasters look remarkably
  like UPC codes or bar codes. The same bar-code-like patterns have been found in
  neurons recorded in different individual animals, and even neurons in different
  species. We speculated that these barcodes could be used as identifiers of discrete
  cell types. The Temporal Barcode Dataset provides \"barcodes\" for visually responsive
  neurons throughout the mouse brain, enabling a test of this hypothesis."
