description: "When cortical neurons are injected with white noise current in a slice,
  the elicited spike times are highly reproducible (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995). Visual
  neurons also respond to white noise flicker visual stimuli with high temporal precision,
  for example in retinal ganglion cells, LGN, or cortical area MT, to name just a
  few. Similar results are reported in other sensory modalities (e.g. Kayser et al,
  2010; Jarocka et al, 2021). When such stimuli are presented repeatedly and the neural
  responses displayed as spike rasters, the rasters look remarkably like UPC codes
  or bar codes. The Temporal Barcode Dataset provides these barcodes for visually
  responsive neurons throughout the brain of an awake mouse.\n\nAstonishingly, the
  same bar-code-like patterns have been found in neurons recorded in different individual
  animals, and even neurons in different species. The temporal pattern of one neuron’s
  response to the same visual stimulus sequence at different contrasts are systematically
  related, as are responses of the same neuron to the same visual stimulus sequence
  at different luminance (Lewen et al., 2001). These findings have implications for
  dynamical models of neural spike coding (Fellous et al, 2004, Wang et al 2019).
  We speculated that these barcodes could be used as identifiers of discrete cell
  types.\n\nThis experiment used the OpenScope Neuropixels passive viewing protocol,
  and displayed visual stimuli modulated in time by a short, repeated white noise
  sequence. The visual stimulus was either a spatially uniform field whose luminance
  was modulated in time (Full Field Flicker), or a standing sinusoidal grating whose
  contrast was modulated in time (Static Gratings). The best evidence for temporal
  barcodes has come from early visual areas (retina and LGN). Therefore, to obtain
  large populations of neurons in subcortical areas, roughly half of the mice were
  recorded in a novel electrode configuation. To our surprise, a majority of neurons
  in visual cortical areas responded to full field flicker with clear temporal barcodes."
